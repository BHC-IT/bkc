compile :

git clone https://github.com/BHC-IT/bkc.git
cd bkc
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make





update :
see compile section





create a chain :

./bkcnode --create --use --init=CHAIN_NAME --a

run a chain as admin :

./bkcnode --conf=PATH_TO_CONF --dump=PATH_TO_DUMP --a
default PATH_TO_CONF is ./conf.bkc
default PATH_TO_DUMP is ./dump.dc





connect to an existing chain as miner :

obtain the conf file for the chain.
./bkcnode --conf=PATH_TO_CONF
default PATH_TO_CONF is ./conf.bkc





connect connect to an existing chain as user :
see bkcuser software
