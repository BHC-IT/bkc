about the exchange of data between peer

opcode:

1xx : respond code
2xx : systeme code
3xx : push data code
4xx : pull data code

1xx


2xx
280 : log off.

3xx
301 : push message. use to test the connection between peer.
302 : push the information about node connected to you.
303 : push disconnected peer.
305 : push a transaction with signature & without proof, asking for a proof and parity.
310 : push a transaction with signature & proof & parity.
320 : push a creation with signature.
350 : push your identity (public key).
352 : push your identity (port).
370 : push the current book.
390 : push a user balance

4xx
401 : ask for a 301 signed message.
402 : ask for a 302 full response.
405 : ask for a transaction to be signed.
470 : ask for the current book.
490 : ask for a user balance.





how to send data :
data format:
	the data packet is made of at least 3 field, serialized in JSON format :
		code: represente the opcode,
		data: data field formated for correctly for the opcode
		user: your public key,
		signature: RSA signature of the 3 field above in the algo : "{code:" + code + ",data:" + data + ",user:" + user + "}". needed in noneconnected protocole.




how to send currency as user (without book):
-> : to peer
<- : from peer

trans: transaction representing the sending
parity: transaction representing the parity.

-> 305 data:trans(unsigned)
<- 405 data:{transaction: trans(unsigned), parity: parity(unsigned)}
-> 310 data:{transaction: trans(signed), parity: parity(signed)}
